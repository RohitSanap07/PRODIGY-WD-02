# Prodigy Infotech Internship - Task 02
## Stopwatch Project
In this project a simple and functional stopwatch built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The stopwatch allows users to start, stop,reset and lap the timer, providing an easy-to-use interface with minimalistic design. Itâ€™s a great example of integrating JavaScript for time-based functions and dynamic updates in a web development context.
